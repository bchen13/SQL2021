      "SpaceX and NASA are targeting Saturday, May 1 at 8:35 p.m. EDT, or 00:35 UTC on May 2, for Dragon to autonomously undock from the International Space Station (ISS) and splashdown off the coast of Florida on Sunday, May 2 at approximately 2:57 a.m. EDT, 6:57 UTC, completing its first six-month operational mission to the Station. \n",
      "\n",
      "A series of departure burns will move Dragon away from the orbiting laboratory, followed by the vehicle jettisoning the trunk to reduce weight and mass to help save propellant for the deorbit burn. Once complete, Dragon will re-enter Earth’s atmosphere and deploy its two drogue and four main parachutes in preparation for a soft water landing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aboard the spacecraft will be NASA astronauts Mike Hopkins, Victor Glover, Shannon Walker, and JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi, who flew to the space station on Dragon six months ago when Falcon 9 launched the spacecraft from historic Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sunday, November 15, 2020. \n",
      "\n",
      "Upon splashdown, the Dragon and the astronauts will be quickly recovered and returned to Cape Canaveral and Houston respectively. Once the mission is complete, Dragon will be inspected and refurbished for future human spaceflight missions.\n",

      "INGREDIENTS \n",
      "4 egg whites \n",
      "1 cup granulated sugar  \n",
      "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice  or apple cider vinegar, to  \n",
      "stabilize \n",
      "3 tangerines \n",
      "2 navel oranges \n",
      "1 ruby red grapefruit \n",
      "1½ cups whipped cream (store bought or homemade, see  \n",
      "page xxx) \n",
      "1 tablespoon honey \n",
      "A handful of fresh basil or mint,  to serve \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 250°F. \n",
      "2. In a large bowl, use a stand mixer or a hand mixer on high speed  to beat eggs until frothy, being careful not to over mix, you don’t  want it to look grainy. Add the sugar and lemon juice slowly,  1 tablespoon of sugar at a time, and continue to beat until it forms  stiff peaks. Test it by pulling the whisk quickly up from the bowl  and looking for a pointy, glossy top. \n",
      "3. Spoon the beaten egg whites onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Use a spoon or soft spatula to spread into a rough circle 9 inches  in diameter. Bake until firm, about 1 hour. Allow to cool to room  temperature in the oven with the door open. \n",
      "4. Prepare the citrus by cutting off the rind and white pith so you  can see the citrus flesh. Slice each fruit into ¼-inch-thick rounds.  \n",
      "5. To serve, transfer the cooled pavlova to a platter. Spread the  whipped cream on top, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge.  Arrange the citrus slices, drizzling with honey and garnishing with  fresh basil or mint. \n",
      "\n",
      "TIP: The meringue can be  made ahead of time and  \n",
      "stored for up to 2 days. \n",

      "Josh Duggar was arrested in Arkansas on Thursday. Jill, Josh’s sister, and her husband Derek Dillard told ET exclusively: ‘We just learned this information. It is very sad.’ Duggar was arrested in Washington County and TMZ reports he’s currently being held in a detention center without bail. The outlet has also reported that Duggar’s car dealership in Arkansas was raided in 2019 in connection to a federal probe. Duggar's arrest follows his and wife Anna’s announcement last week that they’re expecting their seventh child together.\n",

      "Set in a beautiful seaside town on the Italian Riviera, Disney and Pixar’s original feature film “Luca” is a coming-of-age story about one young boy experiencing an unforgettable summer filled with gelato, pasta and endless scooter rides. Luca shares these adventures with his newfound best friend, but all the fun is threatened by a deeply-held secret: they are sea monsters from another world just below the water’s surface. Directed by Academy Award® nominee Enrico Casarosa (“La Luna”) and produced by Andrea Warren (“Lava,” “Cars 3”), “Luca” releases June 18 on Disney+.\n",

      "A program called Covax wants to distribute Covid-19 vaccines fairly. Is it working?\n",
      "\n",
      "Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, many of the world’s richest countries poured money into the race for a vaccine. Billions of dollars, from programs like the US’s Operation Warp Speed, funded development that brought us multiple Covid-19 vaccines in record time. But it also determined where those vaccines would go. Before vaccine doses had even hit the market, places like the US and the UK had bought up nearly the entire supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "This turns out to be an old story. In nearly every modern global health crisis, from smallpox to malaria to H1N1, rich countries have bought up vital medical supplies, making poor countries wait sometimes decades for life-saving support. It’s effectively a system in which where you live determines whether you live or die of a preventable disease. Leaving a disease like Covid-19 to spread unchecked in some places also gives it a chance to mutate -- and variants of the virus are already raising alarms. So: how do we get vaccines to countries that can’t afford them?\n",
      "\n",
      "One solution underway is called Covax. It’s a program co-led by the World Health Organization; Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance; and the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Its goal is to get vaccines to lower- and middle-income countries at the same time as rich countries. So how is it supposed to do that? And will it be enough?\n",

      "Daughter of notorious Titan Pilot Viper, Valkyrie lost her father at a young age. She inherited her father’s love of flight, but not his sense of duty. Except in one regard. She swore to kill the man who’d sent her father to die: his Faction Leader, Kuben Blisk. But when the moment came to pull the trigger, she hesitated -- he spoke of Viper with respect. And he challenged her to be better. Valkyrie shot him anyway, but she didn’t take his life. Just his invitation card to the Apex Games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Valkyrie’s jetpack – forged from the remnant’s of Viper’s Northstar Titan – allows her to fly above the battlefield for a limited time. When it’s time to swoop in for the kill, she can unleash a swarm of missiles to damage and disorient her enemy. And if things get too hot she can employ her Ultimate – which allows her and her entire squad the ability to quickly reposition and find the next fight. Valkyrie enters the games with something to prove and ready to rain death down from on high.\n",

      "For the past several years scientists have been trying to account for the 8 million metric tonnes of plastic that we dump into the ocean each year. The assumption was that a large portion of it was floating out in one of the large garbage patches, where swirling debris accumulates thanks to ocean gyres. But recent measurements of the amount of trash in the patches fell far short of what’s thought to be out there. \n",

      "\n",
      "In a previous version of this video, we mistakenly compared the size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch to the area of Australia. It is in fact roughly 1.6 million square kilometers, a little more than twice the size of the state of Texas. A huge area, but not nearly as big as Australia.

      "Directed by Academy Award® winner Steven Spielberg, from a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award® winner Tony Kushner, “West Side Story” tells the classic tale of fierce rivalries and young love in 1957 New York City. This reimagining of the beloved musical stars Ansel Elgort (Tony); Rachel Zegler (María); Ariana DeBose (Anita); David Alvarez (Bernardo); Mike Faist (Riff); Josh Andrés Rivera (Chino); Ana Isabelle (Rosalía); Corey Stoll (Lieutenant Schrank); Brian d’Arcy James (Officer Krupke); and Rita Moreno (as Valentina, who owns the corner store in which Tony works). Moreno – one of only three artists to be honored with Academy®, Emmy®, GRAMMY®, Tony® and Peabody Awards – also serves as one of the film’s executive producers.\n",
      " \n",
      "Bringing together the best of both Broadway and Hollywood, the film’s creative team includes Kushner, who also serves as an executive producer; Tony Award® winner Justin Peck, who choreographed the musical numbers in the film; renowned Los Angeles Philharmonic conductor and GRAMMY Award® winner Gustavo Dudamel, who helmed the recording of the iconic score; Academy Award®-nominated composer and conductor David Newman (“Anastasia”), who arranged the score; Tony Award®-winning composer Jeanine Tesori (“Fun Home,” “Thoroughly Modern Millie”), who supervised the cast on vocals; and Grammy®-nominated music supervisor Matt Sullivan (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Chicago”), who served as executive music producer for the film. The film is produced by Spielberg, Academy Award®-nominated producer Kristie Macosko Krieger and Tony Award®-winning producer Kevin McCollum. “West Side Story” has been adapted for the screen from the original 1957 Broadway show, with book by Arthur Laurents, music by Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and concept, direction and choreography by Jerome Robbins. \n",

      "NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter takes off and lands in this video captured on April 25, 2021, by Mastcam-Z, an imager aboard NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover. As expected, the helicopter flew out of its field of vision while completing a flight plan that took it 164 feet (50 meters) downrange of the landing spot. Keep watching, the helicopter will return to stick the landing. Top speed for today's flight was about 2 meters per second, or about 4.5 miles-per-hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ingenuity Mars Helicopter was built by JPL, which also manages this technology demonstration project for NASA Headquarters. It is supported by NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, and Space Technology Mission Directorate. NASA’s Ames Research Center and Langley Research Center provided significant flight performance analysis and technical assistance during Ingenuity’s development.\n",
      "\n",
      "A key objective for Perseverance’s mission on Mars is astrobiology, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet’s geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and dust). \n",
      "\n",
      "Subsequent NASA missions, in cooperation with ESA (European Space Agency), would send spacecraft to Mars to collect these sealed samples from the surface and return them to Earth for in-depth analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mars 2020 Perseverance mission is part of NASA’s Moon to Mars exploration approach, which includes Artemis missions to the Moon that will help prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet.\n",
